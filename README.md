# Research-Papers

Inspired by Dr. Andrew Ng's advice on [how to read research papers](https://youtu.be/733m6qBH-jI?t=160), I will keep a list of research papers that either I have already read or plan on reading.

| Research Paper Name                                                                  | URL                              | Progress (\*/10)
